        <p>We immediately clear out most of the information in your
        profile (though it may still exist in our database in event
                logs, to be fully deleted once we sort out our <a
                href="https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues/397">data
                retention policy</a>).</p>

        <p>Things we clear immediately include your profile statement, 
        the payroll you're taking, and the payments you're giving.</p>

        <p>We specifically <i>don't</i> delete your past giving and 
        taking history on the site, because that information also belongs 
        equally to other users (the owners of the Teams you gave to and 
        took from).</p>

        <p>After you close your account, your profile page will say,
        &ldquo;The account owner has closed this account.&rdquo;</p>


        <h2>Username</h2>

        <p>We may give your username to someone else if they ask for
        it, but not for at least a year after you close your account
        (unless we determine that you've been infringing a
                trademark).</p>

        <p>Until we give your username to someone else, you can use it
        again if you ever decide to rejoin Gratipay. Simply sign in.</p>
